    <h1 class="entry-title">About</h1>
    
    <p>I am a Python developer with extensive experience and numerous contributions throughout the years. I have been developing for more than 5 years and have participated in a wide range of high class, challenging projects: from distributed systems to back-end RESTful programming with Flask and Django, to the domain of embedded programming.</p>
<p>I never limit myself in developing new professional skills as I’m a polyglot in terms of programming languages. I enjoy learning new languages and technologies and adding this accumulated knowledge to my professional expertise.</p>
<p>My interests lie in distributed, concurrent and functional programming languages. My hobby complements my professional life as I play with compilers and interpreters in my spare time. My most recent commitments are Golang, Clojure and Scala programming language.</p>
<h1>Open Source</h1>
<p>I am grateful to have participated in a number of popular open source projects where I collaborated with world class programmers. Here is a list showcasing some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>func</strong> : </li>
</ul>
<p>I  took part in the Google Summer of Code (2008 - 2009) and did a number of contributions to the prestigous <strong><em>FUNC</em></strong> (Fedora Unified Network Controller) project. The project was mainly written in Python.</p>
<p>You can see a very old fork from the project on my <a href="https://github.com/makkalot/func">github</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>fsrun</strong> : </li>
</ul>
<p>fsrun runs other tasks when a file modification occurs. It is a simple high order lein task written mainly in Clojure programming language. The Github is present here

<p>You can take a look at the whole list of open source projects I’ve been a contributor of here:

<h1>Client Projects</h1>
<p>I have worked with various clients from different industries and background.</p>
<h2>Scalara Engineering Backend Python/Golang Developer (Freelance)(2014)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I worked on a concurrent server written in Golang and had the responsibility to manage remote low-powered devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was responsible for writing a number of encoder/decoders in Golang that talked UDP with remote devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> <strong>Python, Django, Golang, Redis, Ansible, Linux</strong></p>
<p><br/></p>

<li>Created an auto scraping system with Scrapy that was collecting data from various sites
periodically.</li>
<li>Created various background tasks that were responsible for heavy tasks with Celery.</li>
<li>Created a Django Rest API for representing the collected data on ElasticSearch.</li>
<li>Created simple to use deployment scripts with Ansible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> <strong>Python, Scrapy, Django, ElasticSearch, Redis, Celery, Ansible, Linux</strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>MobSafety, Back-End Python Web Developer (Freelance)(2013 - 2013)</h2>
<p>We worked on Learnpal - a mobile learning platform for students. The mission Learnpal has in mind is to help schools manage, secure and utilize mobile devices in an effective way and apply them to the education process.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was responsible for maintaining the platform’s back-end, which consisted mainly of REST services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I created a content publishing service for the students and teachers. It retrieved data from source such as iTunes or Google Play and could be utilized by teachers to diversify the learning process of the students. The service allowed publishing the retrieved data in a unified data format for front-end development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I contributed to a service that maintained a filtered environment, preventing students from visiting inappropriate websites.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technologies: Python, Flask, MongoDB, Celery, REST</strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Blue Chocolate, Inc., Back-End Python Web Developer (Freelance)(2012 - 2013)</h2>
<p>During my work as a contributor at Blue Chocolate, I was involved in the Getsendtask web app development. The app allows users to share and send tasks to one another. The concept of the project was to integrate email clients with tasks lists, achieving a simplified method of sharing and sending the tasks at hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I developed and maintained the back-end REST API for Getsendtask’s front-end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My responsibilities in the project also included the creation of several modules for batch processing with Celery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also developed a specific integration module which allowed users to send tasks to their Google contacts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technologies: Python, Flask, MongoDB, Celery, REST</strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Shooju, Back-End Python Developer (Freelance)(2011 - 2012)</h2>
<p>I was hired to participate in the Shooju project - a distinguished platform for data retrieval.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I created parsers to gather data from a variety of sources and formats (XLS, CSV, remote
APIs). I was responsible for converting the gathered data in pre-defined and easy to process formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also created a multi-processing worker framework for managing data retrieval which scaled
according to the custom client's needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My responsibilities included the development of a modified version of the IPython notebook application. This modification allowed users to easily create data parsers within their web browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last but not least, I worked on a Flask REST API (backed up by CouchDB) to manage worker processes which were using different sources to collect data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technologies: Python, ZeroMQ, Flask, CouchDB, IPython, Tornado</strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Skynet A.Ş, Embedded Linux Developer, Java Back-End Developer (Turkey) (2010 - 2011)</h2>

<li>
<p>During my work here I developed C modules (mainly extensions of the Net-SNMP protocol) for an embedded switch project which was running on Linux OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I worked on an embedded ARM project in which I developed a module that allowed a board to update itself when a newer firmware version was available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also worked as a Java developer in a remote data reading project which involved reading and organizing data from remote metering devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was up to me to create a multi-threaded data processing framework in Java that was able to read many remote metering devices simultaneously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I created parser modules for remote metering devices that were also responsible for storing the output data in a unified format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technologies: C, POSIX, Java, Spring, Linux</strong></p>
